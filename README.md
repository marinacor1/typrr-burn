# Welcome to Typrr-Burn

The interactive typing game that saves birds' lives!


The game is played as follows:

- Bird is consistently trying to fly
- If the player types quickly and correctly the numbers that are appearing on the screen, the bird will stay afloat
- If the player has too many errors, types slowly or not at all, the bird will fall
- If the player finishes typing a sequence of texts without the bird falling out of the sky, they move onto the next level.
- Levels increase in complexity by the diversity of letters created.
- Player accumulates point and the game gets harder and harder.
- There are six levels.
